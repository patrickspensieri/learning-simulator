# learning-simulator
Interactively demonstrates three core concepts from Calculus and Electricity and Magnetism using Java and JavaFX.

(Case Study completed for a Cegep level OOP Java class.)

Allows user to interactively explore the underlying theory and the relationship between certain variables on the
following three topics : 

    i. Infinite Geometric Series
    ii. Lorentz Force (Rail Gun)
    iii. Resistors in Parallel

The program exhibits intuitive and reponsive design to provide a user-friendly experience. 
Graphs are updated live as parameters are changed by the user and as animations play to clearly demonstrate
the underlying theory to the user.
